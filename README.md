# Blood-Bucket

A blood donation is a process whereby a person voluntarily has blood drawn to be used for future transfusions when in need at hospitals for treatment procedures that require them. Donation may be of whole blood (blood drawn directly from the body) or of specific components of the blood; such as red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, and platelets. Blood banks often participate in the process of collecting blood and other procedures such as managing stocks, approving blood requests and updating donation information.

Blood-Bucket is a blood management system.
